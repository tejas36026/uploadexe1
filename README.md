# Authentis: AI-Powered Academic Originality Checker

Authentis is an advanced tool designed to ensure academic integrity by detecting not only plagiarism but also the use of AI humanizers and paraphrasing tools. It goes beyond traditional text-matching by analyzing the entire writing process, including typing rhythm and patterns, to provide a comprehensive originality report.

## The Problem

Standard plagiarism detectors are becoming increasingly obsolete as students turn to sophisticated AI tools to rewrite and "humanize" content. This makes it difficult for educators to determine the true origin of an assignment.

## The Solution: Authentis

Authentis provides a multi-layered analysis to reveal the true genesis of student work.

### Key Features

*   **Keystroke Forensics:** Our core advantage lies in analyzing typing rhythm, paste events, and correction speed to create a unique "author fingerprint" that AI-generated text cannot replicate.
*   **Visual Originality Reports:** We provide clear, color-coded reports that visualize the writing journey, instantly showing what was typed authentically versus what was pasted from an outside source.
*   **Customizable Sensitivity:** Detection thresholds for AI and writing anomalies can be adjusted to suit different assignment types and your institution's specific academic policies.

### How It Works

1.  **Secure Submission:** Students compose work directly in our editor or upload documents. We support various file types and integrate with your Learning Management System (LMS).
2.  **Process & Pattern Analysis:** As work is composed, our engine invisibly tracks every keystroke, paste, and edit. This forensic data is analyzed in real-time.
3.  **Comprehensive Report:** You receive an intuitive, actionable report detailing findings, originality scores, and highlighted areas for your review.
